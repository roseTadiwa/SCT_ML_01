# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms using linear regression. 
By analyzing the dataset and implementing a regression model, I aimed to establish relationships between these features and property prices. 
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of linear regression in forecasting housing market trends.
The code and detailed findings are available in this repository, showcasing a practical application of machine learning in real estate analysis.
